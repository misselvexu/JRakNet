 * This thread is used by a {@link com.whirvis.jraknet.client.RakNetClient
 * RakNetClient} to discover servers without needing to be explicitly started.
 * <p>
 * Only one instance of this class can exist at a time. When a client is
 * created, it will automatically check if a discovery system is already
 * running. If none exists, one will be created and started automatically. Once
 * the last client using the discovery system has shutdown, it will shut down
 * the discovery system and nullify the reference. If another client is created
 * after this, the process will repeat.
